# Expense Tracker (Vite + React)

This workspace contains React + TypeScript mockups and UI components.

Note: The editing environment here doesn't have Node/npm available. Run the following commands locally on your machine (PowerShell) to install dependencies and start the dev server.

PowerShell commands:

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'D:\APP Dev\Expense Tracker'
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you prefer pnpm or yarn, use those instead:

pnpm:
```powershell
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

yarn:
```powershell
yarn
yarn dev
```

Files added:
- `package.json` — dependency list and scripts
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript config
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite + React plugin
- `index.html` — Vite entry
- `.gitignore`

## Preview
